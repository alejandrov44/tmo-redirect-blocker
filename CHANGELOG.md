This is the lastest release of the [tmo-redirect-blocker](https://github.com/alejandrov44/tmo-redirect-blocker) project.

It will generate a `dist` folder inside a zip file that you can easily download so that you don't have to run the project by yourself.

Download and unzip the folder to be able to use it as the [guide](https://github.com/alejandrov44/tmo-redirect-blocker/blob/main/README.md) says.
